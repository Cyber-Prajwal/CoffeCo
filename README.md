# CoffeCo
We created a Coffee Blog website for a hypothetical firm called CoffeCo using HTML CSS JS and PHP and hosted using XAMPP, and on our contact us page, we've included a form where visitors may provide their basic information, as well as a description of their problem or any suggestions for CoffeeCo. The data entered by user on contact page is stored in an Oracle database.
The site's administrator / owner may then analyse the data, which can help the company improve.
