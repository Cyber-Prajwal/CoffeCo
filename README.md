# CoffeCo Coffee blog website hosted using XAMPP and Oracle used to store customer form details [Academic Project]
We used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and XAMPP to construct a website for a fictitious company named CoffeCo. On our contact page, we've included a form where visitors can submit their contact information as well as a description of their issue or any suggestions they may have for CoffeeCo. The information that users provide on the contact page is kept in an Oracle database.
The owner or administrator of the website can then analyse the information to help the business grow.
